          ***** tech salvage, the general agent cannot look for  *****
          ***** salvage from a specific race. The general agent  *****
          ***** is less expensive to compensate.                 *****

          ***** Each race has an Agent specializing in the       *****
          ***** location of salvage from that race. The contract *****
          ***** specifies that only ships of the race specified  *****
          ***** will be returned from the mission.  This is more *****
          ***** expensive, but can assist commanders seeking a   *****

          *****      When contracting an agent to undertake a    *****
          ***** salvage mission, commanders must provide tech to *****
          ***** the agent, which can be traded by the agent for  *****
          ***** ships, salvage contracts, or wormhole locations. *****
          ***** For every tech spent, the agent will conduct one *****
          ***** search.                                          *****
          *****                                                  *****
          ***** When the commander initiates the contract, he or *****
          ***** she may specify up to 5 ships (1 for every tech  *****
          ***** spent, up to a limit of 5) for the agent to make *****
          ***** priority targets.                                *****

          ***** Once the commander has contracted the agent      *****
          ***** and specified their priority targets, searching  *****
          ***** will begin, and the agent will notify you of any *****
          ***** results. Once all searches are concluded, the    *****
          ***** agent will compare the results with the ship     *****
          ***** list specified by the commander, and award the   *****
          ***** commander the most powerful version of the ship  *****
          ***** which is highest ranked on the list.  If no ship *****

          *****      If Commander Tom spends 5 tech to contract  *****

          ***** matches.  The first and third priority targets   *****

          ***** If Commander Tom had spent only 1 tech, only one *****
